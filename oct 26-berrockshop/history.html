       <p>We brought to this business a strong work
       ethic and a vision...We would create a place
       where the food was the focus. Everything had
       to be absolutely made from scratch like you
       would at home...in small batches each day.
       Real food made by real people, not machines...
       where the mixing and prepping are done by hand
       and where you would use only quality ingredients.
       The world was moving faster, but we wanted a simple
       place, quiet atmosphere with the best comfort
       food...nothing fancy or trendy...just good,
       wholesome food reminiscent of years gone by.</p>
       <p>The berrocks were our specialty,
         of course, and over time, we began to introduce
         other varieties. We were the first in our area
         to do this. Our first new variety was the
         shredded beef berrock, made with lean roast
         that is actually shred by hand. The barbeque
          beef and Mexican berrocks followed, along
          with the breakfast berrocks and the hors
          d'oeuvre berrocks which are so popular for
          entertaining. Since our berrocks are all
          hand made, not machine made, we are
         able to customize them in size and variety.</p>
         <p>
           Our first year was full of menu improvements.
           We began making our own bread for the burgers
           and sandwiches, made homemade soups rather
           than serving canned, and expanded the deli
           salads with the addition of pasta, bean and
           rice pudding. Soon our famous chicken pot
           pies were introduced, and they quickly became
           a permanent menu item. We baked our own cookies
           which are actually old family recipes and
           offered fruit pies and turnovers with our
           delicious flaky crust.

           Before long, our slogan, "Where Homemade is the Difference,"
           was born, because it was clear that our
           passion for home cooking was what set us
           apart from our competitors. It wasn't about
           factory produced, high volume wholesaling...
           it was about the food. And by 1997, we had
           outgrown our small shop at Clinton and Weber
           and moved to our current larger location at
           Bullard and West Avenues in North Fresno.
         </p>
         <p>
           We continued to expand our menu,
           adding more fresh salads and sandwich
           choices. But we never forgot what got us
           here...that little shop at Clinton & Weber
           where we proudly made all our food from
           scratch in small batches...the way we still
           do...almost 30 years later.
